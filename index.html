    <div>
        <p id="first-p" class="desc">Lynn Ann Conway is an American computer scientist, electrical engineer, inventor, and transgender activist.
        Conway is notable for a number of pioneering achievements. She worked at IBM in the 1960s and is credited with 
        the invention of generalized dynamic instruction handling, a key advance used in out-of-order execution,
        used by most modern computer processors to improve performance. She is also widely-known for the Mead-Conway VLSI chip design 
        revolution in very large scale integrated (VLSI) microchip design.</p>

        <p class="desc">  That revolution spread rapidly through the research universities and computing industries during the 1980s,
        incubating an emerging electronic design automation industry, spawning the modern ‘foundry’ infrastructure for
        chip design and production, and triggering a rush of impactful high-tech startups in the 80s and 90s.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="blue-b">Conway grew up in White Plains, New York. Conway was shy and experienced gender dysphoria as a child. She became fascinated and engaged by astronomy (building a 6-inch (150 mm) reflector telescope one summer) and did well in math and science in high school.</p>
